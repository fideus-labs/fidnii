# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Usage

Add a changeset when your PR includes a user-facing change to `@fideus-labs/fidnii`:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Follow the prompts to select the package and describe the change. This creates a
markdown file in `.changeset/` that is committed with your PR.

When changesets are merged to `main`, a "Version Packages" PR is automatically
opened (or updated) with the accumulated changelog and version bump. Merging
that PR publishes to npm.
